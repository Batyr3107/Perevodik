Chapter 1: The Holy Holy Son is a Dog Licker? No, I Choose to Slack Off!

In the Primordial Holy Land.

As the most top-tier power in the Nine Heavens Realm, the Primordial Holy Land boasts a long history and profound depth. Within the vast Nine Heavens Realm, no one dares to underestimate the Primordial Holy Land.

Banished Immortal Peak.

One of the nine main peaks of the Primordial Holy Land, only the Holy Son of each generation can reside there.

At the loft on the peak. Jiang Chen silently watched the distant sea, his expression complex, muttering to himself: "I've actually traveled to another world! Even into a novel? Life is so unpredictable!"

Jiang Chen felt uneasy. Waking up from a sleep, he found himself having traveled to another world. Traveling was one thing, but to a novel was another. This novel was called "Nine Heavens Realm." A typical, cliché fantasy novel.

Once popular for a while, Jiang Chen had read it. Its overly dramatic plot was vivid in his memory. Especially the villainous Holy Son, backed by the Immortal Holy Land, possessing peerless talent, and being incredibly handsome, a rare sight among men.

A quintessential fantasy rich and handsome guy, destined to become a supreme figure, shining brilliantly! Yet, this Holy Son turned out to be a dog licker, obsessively fawning over the female protagonist which was his junior sister.

However, the junior sister did not appreciate it but instead despised the Holy Son. Ultimately, due to going too far with his actions and assaulting the male protagonist, he was slain by the male protagonist and despised by everyone.

Hmm.

This dog-licking Holy Son is now Jiang Chen. He transmigrated as this dog-licking villainous Holy Son.

"Having the supreme physique of the Origin Dao Body, and being the Holy Son of the Primordial Holy Land, why stoop to being a dog licker?"

"Clearly having the opportunity to become an emperor, yet choosing to be a dog licker and cutting off his own future!" Jiang Chen was speechless.

When he first read this novel, he thought the Holy Son was crazy. For a woman, he could give up everything. Even forsaking his own cultivation, and in the end, he was slain! Isn't that being crazy?

The female protagonist was also nuts. In the original story, the female protagonist Ye Qingcheng experienced a family massacre, with her entire family slaughtered, and Jiang Chen happened to pass by the Ye family and rescued her.

Instead of being grateful, she wrongfully accused Jiang Chen of being the family's enemy, harboring hatred towards him all along. Always wanting to kill Jiang Chen to avenge her family. Only after Jiang Chen was killed did she realize the enemy was not him, but the father of the male protagonist, Du Guyun!

The most absurd part, even after knowing all this, Ye Qingcheng still chose to be with Du Guyun. Knowing he was the enemy of her family, yet still choosing to be with him. Isn't that crazy?

"Stay as far away from this Ye Qingcheng as possible!" Jiang Chen said to himself in his heart! And since he replaced the original character, he naturally wouldn't play the role of a dog licker. Backed by the Primordial Holy Land and possessing the supreme talent of the Origin Dao Body, he ought to strive for the ultimate emperor's path, to become a supreme emperor revered by all!

As for the male and female protagonists, let those two dogs play by themselves. As for the plot, it's none of his business!

At that moment, a cold voice sounded.

"Ding, system starting to load!"

"Ding, system successfully loaded!"

"Ding, the Slack-Off System is at your service!"

A golden finger has arrived? But this golden finger seems a bit too special. Jiang Chen's mouth twitched, he had read plenty of novels. He had encountered various systems, but this was his first time encountering a Slack-Off System.

"System, what is your ability?" Although the system was a bit odd, as a golden finger, he still needed to understand it clearly. After all, it was going to be a major aid in the future.

"Host, the system doesn't have any abilities except one, and that is to slack off!"

"As long as the host slacks off, rewards can be obtained! The longer you slack off, the greater the rewards!"

"Once a certain number of days of slacking off is reached, additional rewards will be granted!"

Hearing this, Jiang Chen was stunned for a moment, his mouth twitching slightly, helplessly saying: "Your system ability is quite unique!"

He was speechless. He had seen thousands of systems. But never one like this. Actually asking him to slack off. Damn. As a good young man of the new era, he should be positive and strive hard in life, how could he slack off and waste his days.

"System, when does slacking off start?"

"I can start now!" Jiang Chen asked.

"It has already started after the system was activated!"

"Just persist in slacking off until tomorrow, and you can get a day's slack-off reward!" The system answered.

"Then that's good! Ah, your appearance makes my heart ache, originally I was an upbeat young man!" Jiang Chen sighed, looking heartbroken and helpless.

"If the host really hates slacking off, the system can transform into an Effort System, where rewards can be obtained by making an effort··"

Before the system could finish, Jiang Chen quickly interjected, saying, "No, no, no, I was just joking!" Joking. Why make an effort if he could slack off? Effort is life, slacking off is living. Since he could improve by slacking off, why would he choose to make an effort?

"Suddenly asking me to slack off, it feels a bit uncomfortable!" Jiang Chen said to himself in his heart. Back on Earth, due to life's pressures, he was also a bit of a "workaholic". Although not as extreme as some ultimate workaholics, he was still part of the rat race. Now being asked to completely slack off and do nothing, it made Jiang Chen feel a bit uncomfortable.

'Huh?' Suddenly, Jiang Chen sensed a familiar aura rapidly approaching. Banished Immortal Peak, as the living place of the Holy Son. Few could enter, even elders had to report first. Only Jiang Chen's master, the Lord of the Primordial Holy Land, could come and go freely. Besides him, there was one other person who could move freely in Banished Immortal Peak. That was Jiang Chen's junior sister, Ye Qingcheng!

Jiang Chen's fondness for Ye Qingcheng was well-known, besides, Jiang Chen had specially given Ye Qingcheng a token, allowing her free entry into Banished Immortal Peak!

Sensing the aura getting closer, Jiang Chen turned around, and before his eyes, a breathtakingly beautiful face appeared. Ye Qingcheng, true to her name. A beauty unparalleled in the world, breathtakingly gorgeous. Ye Qingcheng wore a blue dress, perfectly showcasing her figure, her aura ethereal, like a fairy descending to earth, stunning to behold.

"My junior sister may be brainless, but she's indeed top-notch in all aspects, can't really find any faults!"

"No wonder she used to mesmerize me!" A flash of amazement passed through Jiang Chen's eyes, he said to himself in his heart! But outwardly, he spoke gently: "Junior Sister, what brings you here today?"

Just as Ye Qingcheng was about to speak, she stopped. Wait. What was that voice just now! Jiang Chen is saying she's brainless! Initially not showing much expression towards Jiang Chen. Now hearing Jiang Chen say she's brainless, Ye Qingcheng's expression immediately darkened.
