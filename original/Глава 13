Chapter 13: Thank You, My Dear Sister!

The All Pleasure Sect practices the Yin-Yang Dao, seeking to unravel its mysteries. Anything related to the Yin-Yang Dao is a coveted treasure for the sect, particularly the Innate Yin-Yang Qi, the most desired of all.

It’s the perfect heavenly material for the sect’s methods, especially since only with Innate Yin-Yang Qi can the sect’s most powerful technique be fully mastered.

However, this qi is exceedingly rare, and few disciples can perfectly control the Supreme Yin-Yang Scripture due to its scarcity. Even after thousands of years, no disciple has achieved this.

“My dear sister, this item isn’t suitable for you. Let me, your little sister, have it!” Yan Ruyu said with a gentle and alluring voice that captivated both men and women.

Feeling Yan Ruyu’s enchantment, Ye Qingcheng suppressed her emotions and coldly said, “Dream on! How could I give up the Innate Yin-Yang Qi? According to Jiang Chen, it’s vital for my rise. If I give it up, wouldn’t I be cutting off my own path to greatness? I can’t agree to this, no matter what.”

“If you really want it, sister, I can let you have it,” Yan Ruyu surprisingly offered generously, leaving Ye Qingcheng puzzled. “But sister, think carefully. To refine the Innate Yin-Yang Qi, male and female qi combination is a must. It won’t work with one less or one more.”

“Only through cultivation between opposite sexes can it be refined. If you want it, I don’t mind giving it to you, but I’ll just grab some male cultivator from outside. By then, you’ll lose your purity. What do you think Holy Son would think if he founds out about this?”

Yan Ruyu said this with a laugh. She knew Ye Qingcheng, the ice-cold snow lotus, prided herself on her purity.

The idea of giving herself to any male cultivator would be more unbearable than death. And she was sure Ye Qingcheng lacked the ability to claim the Innate Yin-Yang Qi for herself, requiring special methods known to few, the All Pleasure Sect being the most proficient.

Yan Ruyu’s words indeed scared Ye Qingcheng, who stepped back at the thought of the consequences and how Jiang Chen might react. She didn’t want to become such a person. Seizing the moment, Yan Ruyu quickly took out a black jade bottle and tapped it.

A divine light flew out, capturing the Innate Yin-Yang Qi. “Since you’re unwilling, sister, I won’t trouble you further. The Innate Yin-Yang Qi is mine now!” Yan Ruyu laughed like bells and swiftly retreated. Her words had been mere threats.

“This treasure is vital for me, for forging my Dao foundation and raising my limits,” she stated.

“You!” Ye Qingcheng was furious, ready to explode, but Yan Ruyu had already disappeared. “I wasn’t decisive enough,” Ye Qingcheng sighed internally. She wasn’t sure if her methods could secure the Innate Yin-Yang Qi. Her hesitation, fueled by Yan Ruyu’s words, let Yan Ruyu act quickly and succeed.

“It’s a pity the Innate Yin-Yang Qi is gone, one of Heaven-Piercing Sect’s most precious treasures,” Ye Qingcheng lamented. According to Jiang Chen, it was the foundation of her rise, a chance to stand alongside the young supremes. Now, that chance was gone.

“What Jiang Chen said was true. The Innate Yin-Yang Qi, the Heaven-Piercing Palm, it was all here. Does that mean the voice I heard in the past was real, and I misunderstood him?” she thought, filled with regret and irony for mistaking her benefactor for an enemy.

“I wronged him,” she acknowledged solemnly. She resolved to change, to support Jiang Chen in this life, aware it was somewhat late but still hopeful. “But first, I must find out who Du Goyun’s father is!” Ye Qingcheng’s eyes flashed with resolve.

“Damn those Wang brothers, I’ll make them pay!” Du Goyun grumbled and cursed the Wang brothers as he finally made it inside. The four brothers had brought him great humiliation and loss of face. He vowed that if he ever achieved anything significant, he would first seek revenge on the Wang brothers.

“Isn’t this trouble of your own making?” Cang Lao internally criticized Du Goyun. If only Du Goyun had been more mature and steady, and not sought trouble, would he have faced such embarrassment? Of course, Cang Lao couldn’t say this outright.

With all the misfortunes that had befallen Du Goyun recently, saying more might just explode his temperament, possibly even leading to resentment towards Cang Lao. For his own goal of reconstructing his body, Cang Lao chose to remain silent.

Yet, Du Goyun’s misfortunes were far from over. Soon, Ye Qingcheng approached him.

“Ye Sister!” Du Goyun exclaimed with joy upon seeing her. His previous discontent and anger vanished, replaced by a broad smile as if he were a fawning dog looking at Ye Qingcheng.

‘Surely Ye Sister still adores me. Her coldness outside must have been just to protect me,’ Du Goyun happily thought to himself.

‘I doubt that’s the case,’ Cang Lao thought, looking solemnly at the approaching Ye Qingcheng. She appeared as if she was intent on harming Du Goyun.
