Chapter 11 : The Heaven-Piercing Sect Opens, The Son of Destiny Failed to Pretend!

Yan Ruyu giggled melodiously, her eyes playful as she looked at Ye Qingcheng. “Fairy Ye, why do you look so upset? And where is the Primordial Holy Land’s Holy Son? You two used to be inseparable. Now that he’s nowhere to be seen, it seems the rumors are true – the Holy Son has given up pursuing Fairy Ye.”

“It’s such a pity. A devoted man like the Holy Son is rare. If I were Fairy Ye, I would have agreed long ago!”

Jiang Chen’s absence and his usual closeness with Ye Qingcheng were well-known, and this matter had been widely discussed. However, since Jiang Chen hadn’t made any public appearances, the people of Primordial Holy Land merely speculated. Some thought he might be in secluded cultivation and too busy to appear.

The disciples of Primordial Holy Land took it as a mere rumor. Now that Yan Ruyu had spoken openly about it, it surprised many from Primordial Holy Land, who couldn’t help but look towards Ye Qingcheng.

People from various factions were also very curious. Gossip is human nature, and even cultivators are no exception, especially gossip about Jiang Chen and Ye Qingcheng.

As one of the top geniuses of the Nine Heavens Realm, Jiang Chen was well-known for his unrequited love for Ye Qingcheng. His persistence despite repeated rejections had amazed many. People wondered whether it would end with Jiang Chen giving up or Ye Qingcheng being moved.

“What does that have to do with you!” Ye Qingcheng glared at Yan Ruyu, clearly annoyed. Ever since her emergence, she and Yan Ruyu had been hailed as the two most dazzling beauties of their generation.

While Ye Qingcheng never cared for such comparisons, Yan Ruyu always seemed to find a way to confront her. Every encounter with Ye Qingcheng was a chance for Yan Ruyu to provoke her.

“Of course, it matters to me!” Yan Ruyu said cheerfully. “If the Holy Son stops being lovesick, then I might have a chance!”

“Hah! Even if you dare, neither the All Pleasure Sect nor Primordial Holy Land would allow it!” Ye Qingcheng retorted with a cold laugh.

To take Jiang Chen as a cauldron, even if he agreed, Primordial Holy Land would never permit it, and the All Pleasure Sect wouldn’t dare. As the Holy Son of Primordial, Jiang Chen held the high hopes of the entire Primordial Holy Land.

If Yan Ruyu dared to do such a thing, Primordial Holy Land would flatten the All Pleasure Sect in an instant. The difference in power between immortal forces and top forces was vast. The All Pleasure Sect wouldn’t dare to accept him, fearing Primordial Holy Land’s retribution.

“Hehe, why not? I just want the Holy Son to become my Dao companion, not a cauldron,” Yan Ruyu replied with a smile. “Besides, I am still pure. Even if Primordial Holy Land knew, they wouldn’t say anything!”

“Pure!” Ye Qingcheng laughed mockingly. The saintess of the All Pleasure Sect daring to claim purity was laughable, akin to a courtesan telling clients she was still untouched.

“The Heaven-Piercing Sect is opening!” announced the fifth elder, interrupting the ongoing sharp exchange between the two.

The elders usually avoid meddling in the affairs of the younger generation, but this time, it involved Jiang Chen and the dignity of the Primordial Sect. The fifth elder felt compelled to intervene, especially seeing Ye Qingcheng clearly unable to outtalk Yan Ruyu.

As the elder’s voice resounded, everyone’s attention shifted from the quarrel to the apparition in the sky.

Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens, as if tearing the sky apart. A colorful Soul light revealed a pathway amidst the celestial realm, showing palaces and auspicious beasts, resembling a fairyland. Due to years of abandonment, the vast territory seemed somewhat dilapidated.

With the pathway fully open, various forces sprung into action. “Enter!” commanded the fifth elder in a stern voice. The disciples of the Primordial Sect surged forward. Ye Qingcheng, swift as a sharp sword, was the first to enter the pathway.

“Too many people!” Du Guyun, eager to enter, kept being pushed back due to his slightly inferior strength.

“S-stop right there!” Suddenly, several men blocked the pathway, preventing entry. All four were at least Soul Passage Realm fifth level practitioners.

“If you want to enter, defeat us first!” declared a fierce-faced man, blocking the way with a sinister smile.

“Wang Ba, what are you trying to do?” The blocked crowd was furious, outraged. With so many people, being even a moment late meant everything inside could be taken.

“How bold of Celestial Sect, daring to block us!” The Tianyun Sect quadruplets, born together with a unique connection and extraordinary strength, now stood in everyone’s way.

“Damn it, they’re blocking the way, we can’t get in on time!” The crowd was infuriated, helplessly watching others enter as they were barred.

Despite blocking the pathway, the Wang brothers knew better than to incite public anger. They only stopped those weaker than them, letting stronger individuals pass unimpeded.

This was actually a plot twist in the novel. Du Guyun, angered, would defeat the Wang brothers, using them as a stepping stone to fame. However, in the novel, Du Guyun was much stronger, easily defeating the brothers. Now, without Jiang Chen’s oppression, he had lost many opportunities and was clearly weaker, not even at the Soul Passage Realm.

Du Guyun, ever competitive and strong-willed, challenged them despite being weaker. “Looking for death!” he yelled, attacking furiously. His massive fist, like a falling meteor, exploded with terrifying power.

“Scram!” Wang Ba glanced disdainfully and swatted him away. With a loud thud, Du Guyun was sent flying like a kite with its string cut. To challenge the Soul Passage Realm while only at the Soul Palace Realm was simply courting death.
