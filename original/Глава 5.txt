Chapter 5: The Two with Ulterior Motives!

“Move aside!” Ye Qingcheng demanded without any courtesy, her icy tone and formidable aura forcing Du Guyun to involuntarily step back. As Du Guyun retreated, the ferocious beasts surged forward like a tidal wave.

Dozens of them roared, their intense sound waves almost materializing with powerful offensive force. Their massive bodies lunged towards Ye Qingcheng!

The beasts’ onslaught was ferocious, prompting Du Guyun to instinctively warn, “Be careful, these beasts are at the Soul Passage Realm!” Du Guyun had meticulously attracted these beasts to create a perilous situation for both of them, then planned to use a special secret technique to escape with Ye Qingcheng.

His goal was to move Ye Qingcheng with his sacrificial spirit. If it weren’t for Jiang Chen’s revelations, Du Guyun’s plan might have succeeded. However, Ye Qingcheng was well-prepared for the current danger and was ready to face it.

“Suppressing Mountain Seal!” Ye Qingcheng, unfazed, quickly released a beam of divine light. The light grew rapidly upon contact with the air. Instantly, a colossal seal appeared above, like a massive mountain, its presence overwhelming, suppressing everything.

With a thunderous rumble, the seal descended, unleashing infinite power. The surrounding beasts, like paper mache, burst apart, their blood staining the sky. The vast seal, like a mountain, was powerful enough to destroy everything. Even the dense swarm of beasts couldn’t cross the seal, perishing instantly upon contact.

Gulp. The formidable power of the Suppressing Mountain Seal stunned Du Guyun, leaving him swallowing his saliva in fear. Dozens of Soul Passage Realm beasts were effortlessly slain by Ye Qingcheng, simple as stepping on ants.

Her immense aura and strength sent shockwaves through Du Guyun. “How could she be this powerful?” He was frightened. Ye Qingcheng’s strength far exceeded his expectations.

“Eight level Soul Passage Realm, possessing a Dao weapon, only a Soul Sea Realm expert could harm her, not even numerous Soul Passage Realm beasts,” Canglao commented, unsurprised. He had thought it ridiculous when Ye Qingcheng almost got injured earlier.

As a top disciple of the Primordial Holy Land and at the eighth level of the Soul Passage Realm, it was implausible for her to be harmed by some Soul Passage Realm beasts. Even Soul Sea Realm beasts might not be a match for her. This was the power Ye Qingcheng should have, not like earlier, seemingly vulnerable to the beasts.

Du Guyun had no rebuttal. His intervention now seemed superfluous. “Master, today I may not have reached Ye Qingcheng’s heart, but can I use her to enter the Primordial Holy Land?” he pondered.

His original plan had failed, and now he only thought of using Ye Qingcheng to gain access to the Primordial Holy Land.

As one of the top forces in the Nine Heavens Realm, being a disciple there would greatly benefit Du Guyun. No human disciple would refuse such an opportunity, and Du Guyun was no exception. However, gaining entry to the Primordial Holy Land was not easy. Even the most ordinary outer disciple needed recognition from within the Holy Land and sufficient talent.

Unfortunately, his talent wasn’t outstanding. “It’s hard to say; after all, you did help her, though it wasn’t very effective,” Canglao remarked.

“Maybe Ye Qingcheng will consider this and allow you into the Primordial Holy Land.” Canglao wasn’t entirely sure. Such matters depended on the individual. A kind-hearted person might consider Du Guyun’s life-risking rescue and allow him entry.

Thunderous explosions echoed incessantly, flattening the surrounding area for several kilometers. Ye Qingcheng’s formidable cultivation made the surrounding beasts flee in terror, not daring to come near.

“Ye…this fairy lady!” Du Guyun initially wanted to address her as Fairy Ye but then decided to pretend he didn’t know her. Calling her Fairy Ye directly might make her suspicious, so he chose to feign ignorance.

However, Ye Qingcheng, who was observant, noticed Du Guyun’s slip-up. She realized that Du Guyun indeed knew her, and possibly even orchestrated the attack by these beasts, just as Jiang Chen’s thoughts had suggested.

“What do you want?” Ye Qingcheng asked, her demeanor cold as an iceberg, keeping Du Guyun at bay.

“I wonder how the fairy lady is addressed?” Du Guyun asked with an awkward smile, feeling extremely irritable inside. He was convinced his plan was flawless and that Ye Qingcheng would open her heart to him. However, he hadn’t expected her to be so powerful that she could handle the beast wave all by herself.

“My name is Ye Qingcheng!” she replied, keeping an eye on Du Guyun to see what he was up to.

“Ye Qingcheng, are you the famous Ye Qingcheng from the Primordial Holy Land? The one known as the strongest genius in the Eastern Wilderness?”

Du Guyun feigned surprise, exaggerating her status. He called her the strongest genius, aiming to leave a good impression, thinking no one would refuse such flattery.

“I am not!” Ye Qingcheng thought to herself, finding Du Guyun’s pretense disgusting. He clearly knew her but was pretending otherwise.

“You’re not the Ye Qingcheng of the Primordial Holy Land?” Du Guyun pretended not to understand.

“I am the Ye Qingcheng you speak of, but I’m not the strongest genius in the Eastern Wilderness,” she clarified. “Don’t say such things again; it will only invite ridicule.”

Ye Qingcheng’s expression was complex as she thought of someone from the Primordial Holy Land. Despite her previous dislike for him, in terms of talent, no one in the vast Eastern Wilderness, perhaps even in the entire Nine Heavens Realm, could compare to that person – Jiang Chen, the Son of Primordial.

“But I think Fairy Ye is certainly the strongest genius!” Du Guyun continued, hoping flattery would work. “No one can compare to Fairy Ye!”

“I don’t want to hear that again,” Ye Qingcheng replied, frowning coldly.

Du Guyun, realizing she didn’t appreciate these words, changed the topic: “Fairy Ye, I have long admired the Primordial Holy Land and always wanted to become a disciple there. Unfortunately, I have never met anyone from the Holy Land to recommend me. Can you help me get an introduction?”

“I come from a humble background. My family was annihilated when I was young, and my enemies are too powerful. Ordinary cultivation won’t enable me to seek revenge. I wish to enter the Primordial Holy Land to cultivate in secret, hoping to gain strength and seek vengeance one day.”

All of it was a ruse, an act of self-pity staged by Du Guyun to resonate with Ye Qingcheng. Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng narrowed her eyes, remembering Jiang Chen’s thoughts that her family’s enemy was Du Guyun’s father.

The thought of her family being killed by his father while Du Guyun faked deep grudges to get close to her filled her with disgust and murderous intent. However, considering Du Guyun’s importance to Jiang Chen and her desire to verify the truth of Jiang Chen’s words, she pondered for a moment and said, “I agree.”

Du Guyun was ecstatic, thanking her profusely while inwardly thinking, “Proud woman, I will make you bow to me one day and bring this so-called high-and-mighty fairy down to earth.”
