Chapter 8 : Continuous Slacking Off is Bliss!

"Has Jiang Chen really given up on me?" Ye Qingcheng pondered, her mind a whirlwind of confusion. "Or is this some kind of strategic retreat by him?" Her heart was in chaos; previously, she would have been delighted to be free of Jiang Chen's presence.

Now, however, his absence left her feeling oddly unsettled. Adding to this the internal voices she had heard, her thoughts were running wild, and a mysterious emotion was gradually spreading within her.

"No, I must find out the truth about who really killed my family back then. Was it Jiang Chen, or Du Guyun's father, as Jiang Chen claimed?" Ye Qingcheng took a deep breath. The annihilation of her family, leaving her as the sole survivor, had driven her to train relentlessly for revenge.

She had always believed Jiang Chen was the perpetrator, hence her deep-seated hatred for him. But now, if he wasn't the killer, she wondered if her actions had made her no better than an ungrateful wretch. Such thoughts weighed heavily on her mind.

At Banished Immortal Peak, in the summit garden, Jiang Chen lay leisurely in a chair, enjoying the refreshing breeze. "Slacking off is indeed blissful!" he mused contentedly. "Before I knew it, I've advanced to the second level of the Life-Death Realm! This would have been unimaginable before."

His cultivation level had skyrocketed during his half-month of slacking off, progressing from the sixth level of the True King Realm to the second level of the Life-Death Realm. Such an astonishing rate of advancement was unheard of without extraordinary fortune.

And now, without doing anything, he had effortlessly reached the second level of the Life-Death Realm. Moreover, his various secret techniques had also improved. It was as if he had a 24-hour auto-progress system, constantly advancing.

"What's the point of internal struggle?" he thought to himself. "Slacking off is much more profitable!" The former king of diligence had now fully embraced the art of slacking off. Slacking off is enjoyable, and continuously slacking off is continuously enjoyable!

"According to the plot, the Heaven-Piercing Sect should be emerging soon," Jiang Chen reflected. "I wonder if Du Guyun will gain anything from it?"

He was very familiar with the story, especially its dog-blooded early chapters. Du Guyun's initial rise had been fueled by Jiang Chen's oppression, gaining opportunities and rapidly advancing in cultivation, quickly establishing a foothold in the Holy Origin Land.

According to the story, Du Guyun should now have entered the Soul Passage Realm. But due to Jiang Chen's slacking off, no one paid attention to Du Guyun, causing him to miss several opportunities for tempering and growth.

Consequently, Du Guyun was only at the ninth level of the Soul Palace Realm, barely advancing one minor level in half a month and not reaching the Soul Passage Realm.

"In the original story, due to my suppression, Du Guyun acquired two decent secret techniques, using them to dominate in the Heaven-Piercing Sect and gradually gaining fame in the Eastern Wilderness, even defeating some young prodigies," Jiang Chen remembered.

"Now, without my oppression, Du Guyun hasn't gained these opportunities. If he enters the Heaven-Piercing Sect now, he might not be a match for those prodigies. Maybe he won't be able to show off or face-slap as he used to, possibly gaining nothing."

Jiang Chen had a clear memory of the Heaven-Piercing Sect plot. It was a stage in the early part of the story that enabled Du Guyun's rapid growth. The once powerful Heaven-Piercing Sect in the Eastern Wilderness had been annihilated by a supreme powerhouse.

Its small world disappeared until now. Despite being destroyed, the small world of the sect still contained many treasures, such as the sect's secret technique, the Heaven-Piercing Palm, known for its unparalleled offensive power among holy-grade secret techniques.

In the novel, it was this technique that allowed Du Guyun to dominate early on, easily defeating enemies beyond his realm. The Heaven-Piercing Palm contributed significantly to Du Guyun's early fame, helping him win several tough battles.

Besides, Du Guyun also obtained a special kind of heavenly material and earthly treasure in the Heaven-Piercing Sect, the Innate Yin-Yang Qi. This is an extremely unique treasure, containing the essence of the Yin-Yang Dao. The energy it contains is unimaginable. If one can refine it, they can obtain special constitutions: the Innate Supreme Yang Body and the Innate Supreme Yin Body. Although these aren't as superior as Jiang Chen's Origin Dao Body, they are still precious and not inferior to ordinary Soul bodies. However, refining this treasure requires one condition: dual cultivation. Only through dual cultivation can this heavenly material and earthly treasure be truly refined.

Du Guyun also, through this segment of the story, completely opened up Ye Qingcheng's heart. It can be said that this part of the story was the stepping stone for Du Guyun's rapid progress in the future, forming the foundation of his rise. If he loses these, Du Guyun's future rise will completely lose its foundation.

"Should I continue slacking off?" Jiang Chen pondered this matter. If he slacked off, he would certainly receive better rewards. But if he didn't slack off, there's a high probability that Du Guyun could acquire this heavenly material and earthly treasure.

If he could get this treasure, Du Guyun's subsequent rise would become even more difficult, essentially breaking his initial foundation. Of course, as the son of destiny, if he lost this, he would probably still get good opportunities as compensation later on.

To some extent, the son of destiny favored by fate becomes stronger when faced with oppression; the more they are suppressed, the faster they erupt. If he took away what belonged to Du Guyun first, it might instead trigger fate's compensation, leading Du Guyun to acquire even better things.

"Continue slacking off! I can't be bothered anymore!" After thinking, Jiang Chen decided to continue slacking off. By doing so, he could receive even better things. If lucky, it could be dozens or even thousands of times more valuable than the Innate Yin-Yang Qi.

So why not continue slacking off? As long as he doesn't interfere, whether his slacking off would cause a deviation in the plot is not his concern.

Soon, the plot progressed. The emergence of the Heaven-Piercing Sect caused a huge stir. Even the powerful Primordial Holy Land gathered its high-level figures to discuss this matter. Inside the palace, figures with presence as deep as the sea stood; these were the elders of the Primordial Holy Land, the pillars of the Holy Land.

Each one of them was at least at the Saint Realm. The meeting was called by the third elder of the Holy Land. Besides some elders, some outstanding disciples from within the sect were also present, like Jiang Chen, Ye Qingcheng, and others.

As for the masters of Jiang Chen and Ye Qingcheng, the Holy Master of Primordial was not among them. Their nominal masters, elusive as ghosts, were often not within the Holy Land, and most matters were managed by the Holy Land's elders.

The third elder sat in the center, his face calm, his gentle voice containing a powerful pressure, slowly said, "The latest news: the small world of the Heaven-Piercing Sect has reappeared. The Heaven-Piercing Sect was annihilated in the past, and its small world had hidden itself, with no one knowing where it was."

"Now, for some unknown reason, the small world of the Heaven-Piercing Sect has reappeared, and there are no longer any living beings inside. Why the Heaven-Piercing Sect disappeared remains a mystery, but its small world contains many opportunities.l

"This gathering is to discuss sending people to explore the Heaven-Piercing Sect. Given the sudden appearance of the small world, it's a bit peculiar and may hide many dangers. However, opportunity and danger coexist. If you can withstand these challenges, you can gain the opportunities within, including the Heaven-Piercing Sect's treasure, the Heaven-Piercing Palm."

In simpler terms, the small world of the Heaven-Piercing Sect is a bit peculiar and may contain dangers, but there are also numerous opportunities. If anyone wants to go, they can sign up. With these words, the palace became lively, everyone discussing the matter of the Heaven-Piercing Sect.

Ye Qingcheng, ignoring the surrounding noise, looked in Jiang Chen's direction. Jiang Chen's expression was calm, completely out of sync with the people around him, and indifferent to the so-called Heaven-Piercing Sect.

'There's no danger in the Heaven-Piercing Sect; the people inside were killed long ago. If it weren't for the lack of energy support, the Heaven-Piercing Sect could have remained hidden for tens of thousands of years.'

'But the opportunities in the Heaven-Piercing Sect are indeed not few, especially those in the Heaven-Piercing Sect's Third Peak, hidden behind a rock wall. The people of the Heaven-Piercing Sect are dogs for hiding such profound techniques behind the Third Peak instead of the main peak, quite unexpected. And this Third Peak is strange too, as it contains the Innate Yin-Yang Qi.'

'Speaking of which, the Innate Yin-Yang Qi is key to Du Guyun's rise. Originally in the plot, Du Guyun and Ye Qingcheng refined the Innate Yin-Yang Qi, both gaining extraordinary physiques, which opened their hearts to each other.'

'Speaking of which, Du Guyun is quite disgusting. Knowing that refining the Innate Yin-Yang Qi required blending, he pretended not to know and tricked Ye Qingcheng into refining it with him. And Ye Qingcheng, not knowing what the Innate Yin-Yang Qi was, naively fell for it and had no way back.'

Ye Qingcheng's eyebrows furrowed, her teeth clenched in anger. Jiang Chen was saying she was brainless again! Who said she didn't know what the Innate Yin-Yang Qi was?

Well, she actually didn't. But what's wrong with that? There are so many heavenly materials and earthly treasures, it's normal not to know one or two, right? Wait, how did he know about these things in the Heaven-Piercing Sect? Ye Qingcheng thought to herself,

"If what Jiang Chen is saying is true, then the previous thoughts must also be true. But why does Jiang Chen have the ability to foresee the future?" Ye Qingcheng was extremely puzzled.

The Heaven-Piercing Sect had been hidden for tens of thousands of years before it reappeared. How could anyone know what was inside? This left Ye Qingcheng utterly baffled. Could it be that Jiang Chen really had the ability to foresee the future? And why would he have such an ability? She sighed softly to herself, thinking,

"The whole truth will be known once I go to the Heaven-Piercing Sect. If what Jiang Chen said is true, then he really does have the ability to foresee the future."

Thinking this, Ye Qingcheng felt very conflicted. If all of this was true, then hadn't she wronged Jiang Chen? And he knew she had wronged him, which is why he was so repulsive towards her?
