Chapter 6: Slacking Off, Preventing the Protagonist from Stealing the Show!

Not long after Ye Qingcheng brought Du Guyun into the Primordial Holy Land, this news reached Jiang Chen. As the Holy Sonof the Holy Land, his status was revered, second only to the Holy Master.

He didn't need to actively seek out information; it naturally came to him, facilitated by his subordinates. Everyone was aware of his long-standing affection for Ye Qingcheng, so news about her always reached him first.

"Young Master, I noticed Du Guyun seems quite close to Fairy Ye. Should we do something about it?" Wang Hu, a muscular man, inquired. He was the chief guard of Banished Immortal Peak, had impressive cultivation, and had been faithfully serving Jiang Chen for many years, handling numerous tasks.

Knowing the Young Master's affection for Ye Qingcheng and assuming she would become Jiang Chen's Dao companion, Wang Hu often paid special attention to news about Ye Qingcheng.

"No need," Jiang Chen dismissed the idea. "From now on, don't bother reporting anything about Ye Qingcheng to me. It's just a waste of time." Jiang Chen, now slacking off, showed no interest in involving himself with the main characters of the story.

Wang Hu appeared stunned, as if he had misheard. Usually, Jiang Chen would show keen interest in news about Ye Qingcheng, but now he seemed indifferent or even disdainful. Had the Holy Sonlost his feelings for Ye Qingcheng?

"Understood," Wang Hu replied, perfectly fulfilling his role as a subordinate. Since Jiang Chen was no longer focused on Ye Qingcheng, he wouldn't pry further.

To avoid any overthinking among his subordinates, Jiang Chen added, "And as for that Du Guyun, don't interfere with him either." Like most villains in stories, Jiang Chen had previously suppressed Du Guyun.

Ironically, this suppression often led to Du Guyun's rapid rise and strong establishment in the Primordial Holy Land. Now that Jiang Chen was slacking off, he had no intention of bothering with Du Guyun. He was curious to see if Du Guyun could rise rapidly without his involvement.

"Ding, congratulations to the host for successfully slacking off. You have obtained the saint-grade secret technique, Universe in the Palm!" a cold voice announced. Recognizing Jiang Chen's non-interference as slacking off, the system immediately awarded him.

"Saint-grade secret technique, not bad!" Jiang Chen's eyes sparkled. Even as the Holy Sonof the Holy Land, he already possessed high-level divine techniques and secret methods. Not to mention saint-grade secret techniques, Jiang Chen was familiar with several imperial scriptures. However, having more of such high-level saint techniques was always beneficial.

Nobody would complain about having too many, as saint-grade secret techniques are incredibly powerful, unparalleled in attack, and offer significant combat prowess and effects. Having one more such technique essentially meant an addition to his combat strength and another trump card in his arsenal.

Host: Jiang Chen

Age: 19

Realm: Sixth level of True King Realm

Talent: Origin Dao Physique

Secret Techniques: Primordial Emperor Scripture, Extreme Cosmos, Thirty-Three Heavens Scripture, A Thought through Eternity, Universe in the Palm…

saint Weapons: Origin Dao Sword, Supreme Soul Seal…

This was Jiang Chen's current status. His cultivation had reached the sixth level of the True King Realm, and he possessed one of the strongest physiques, the Origin Dao Physique. His practiced secret techniques were impressive, with the Primordial Emperor Scripture and Extreme Cosmos being imperial scriptures created by great emperors of the past.

The rest of his techniques started from saint-grade. His saint weapons were also of the same grade, including the unparalleled Origin Dao Sword and the Supreme Soul Seal, an ultimate treasure for protecting the soul.

With these assets, Jiang Chen could face even the Life and Death Realm without fear. He could even boldly claim that in the vast Nine Heavens Realm, among his peers of the same realm, few could contend with him.

"With such a background, why would I need to chase after a brainless woman!" Jiang Chen shook his head as he looked at his status. He couldn't understand why his original self, with the strongest background, top-notch talent, powerful secret techniques, and divine weapons, would pursue a woman who didn't love him, abandoning his greatest strengths.

"With such conditions, I should be contending for the Emperor's path, aiming for the realm of a supreme emperor! Even if I can't become an emperor, my future achievements would at least reach the quasi-emperor level. In the vast Nine Heavens Realm, I'd still be one of the highest-status individuals. But the original self couldn't figure it out and chased after a brainless woman."

"I've been slacking off for three days now, and my realm has already improved by a minor level. At this rate, it won't take long to reach the Life and Death Realm!" Jiang Chen planned his future development.

After entering the True King Realm, progression in realms becomes incredibly slow. His improvement by a minor level in just three days was exceptionally rare. Moreover, the longer he slacks off, the faster his cultivation will grow, and stepping into the Emperor Realm isn't just a fantasy.

In this world, the realms are divided into: Physical, True Spirit, Soul Palace, Soul Passage, Soul Sea, True King, Life and Death, Great Master, Saint Realm, and Emperor Realm, each with nine levels.

Jiang Chen, currently at the sixth level of the True King Realm, was a rarity among his peers.

"I remember the first major improvement Du Guyun had was because I ordered my subordinates to suppress him, which led him to a great opportunity that significantly increased his cultivation. This even gave him some fame in the Primordial Holy Land and helped him stabilize his footing!"

"Now that I'm not suppressing Du Guyun, I'm curious to see if he can achieve a significant improvement on his own!"

Jiang Chen thought to himself. Du Guyun's early advancements were closely related to Jiang Chen. Suppression was actually an opportunity, a way to face challenges. Now that he was slacking off, he was interested to see how Du Guyun would handle challenges and gain opportunities.
