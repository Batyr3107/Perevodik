Chapter 7: The Self-important Du Guyun and the Frustrated Cang Lao!

Jiang Chen's subordinates executed his orders well. Nobody caused trouble or deliberately suppressed Du Guyun. Du Guyun wasn't ostracized for being brought in by Ye Qingcheng; instead, he was treated as an ordinary inner disciple.

Half a month passed without any significant events, and Du Guyun continued his cultivation in the Primordial Holy Land in a routine manner. This excessive calmness, however, seemed odd to Du Guyun and made him uncomfortably suspicious.

"Master, I don't know why, but I always feel something's off," Du Guyun silently communicated to his master.

"What seems off to you?" Cang Lao was puzzled. Wasn't this peaceful cultivation environment ideal?

"I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just feels too peaceful. Isn't it widely rumored that the Holy Son of the Primordial Holy Land adores Ye Qingcheng? Normally, any man associated with Ye Qingcheng would face rejection from the Holy Son's side."

"I was brought in by Ye Qingcheng and should have a decent relationship with her, so shouldn't the Holy Son be opposing me? But half a month has passed, and there's been no suppression or rejection. This feels very strange to me, quite unsettling," Du Guyun explained, frowning.

He even felt as if something very important had disappeared, causing an inexplicable irritation as if something had drifted away from him for some special reason, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was.

Cang Lao chuckled dryly, "You're overthinking it. Think about it from the Holy Son's perspective. If you heard that Ye Qingcheng brought in an ordinary disciple without exceptional talent or strength, would you care? To someone at his level, ordinary disciples are like ants. Would you bother about an ordinary ant?"

Cang Lao thought Du Guyun had a masochistic tendency. While others would prefer friendly relations, Du Guyun actually expected rejection and suppression, which seemed rather bizarre.

Du Guyun opened his mouth as if to retort, but upon reflection, he realized Cang Lao's words made sense. Even though being compared to an ant was uncomfortable, it was the harsh truth. He couldn't argue against it, as in every aspect, he couldn't compare to Jiang Chen.

Feeling Du Guyun's low spirits, Cang Lao tried to comfort him, "But don't be disheartened. This is actually an opportunity for you. The less they notice you, the more time you have to rise. Once you do, it will undoubtedly be a slap in their faces."

"Even an ant can shake the heavens! Your talent may be average now, but you have enough potential to rise. You just need time. Given enough time, even the Primordial Holy Land could be under your feet. And remember, a Holy Son can be replaced. If you surpass him, you can become the new Holy Son and look down upon him."

Cang Lao racked his brains to stabilize Du Guyun's mood and encourage him to cultivate steadily, knowing that Du Guyun was someone with a high opinion of himself.

Although Du Guyun didn't have many outstanding qualities, he was ultimately the key to Cang Lao's future rebirth. Thus, Cang Lao had no choice but to comfort him and encourage him to keep pushing forward.

"I understand, Master," Du Guyun said with a deep breath, his eyes full of determination. Cang Lao's earnest advice had been effective, quickly lifting Du Guyun's previously unstable spirits.

He set a new goal for himself: to surpass Jiang Chen and trample him underfoot. He wanted to show that even an 'ant' like him could shake the heavens. After all, he was no ant, and Jiang Chen was not the heavens.

Cang Lao sighed with relief, having finally dealt with Du Guyun's issues. Du Guyun was a real hassle, thinking highly of himself and yet not being very resolute. He was occasionally melodramatic and liked to blame everything and everyone.

"It's good that you understand," Cang Lao said with a chuckle. "Life is long. Being the first to advance isn't important; what matters is who reaches the finish line first. I believe you'll get there faster than Jiang Chen."

"Master, if you had to choose, would you pick Jiang Chen or me?" Du Guyun, for some reason, seemed fixated on comparing himself to Jiang Chen.

Cang Lao's voice halted, and his expression changed, cursing inwardly. Always comparing! What did Du Guyun have to compare with Jiang Chen? If there was a real choice, anyone with a brain would pick Jiang Chen.

Choosing Jiang Chen meant Cang Lao could immediately reconstruct his physical body; why would he need to suffer alongside Du Guyun?

Cang Lao was exasperated. Du Guyun seemed to have no self-awareness. Maybe in the future, but right now, he had nothing to compare with Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen outclassed Du Guyun in every aspect. Without divine vision, anyone with a bit of sense would choose Jiang Chen.

Cang Lao had said that the first one to reach the finish line would be successful, but he didn't mention that for many, someone else's starting point was their endpoint. Of course, some people do surpass those with higher starting points, but they are rare.

"Of course, I would choose you," Cang Lao said, despite his internal tirade, trying to boost Du Guyun's confidence. After all, he had no choice.

"Don't worry, Master, I will definitely surpass Jiang Chen!" Du Guyun, reassured by Cang Lao's response, felt an endless surge of power within him, his fighting spirit soaring.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingcheng was also paying attention to Jiang Chen's actions, especially after Du Guyun joined the Primordial Holy Land. She wanted to see if Jiang Chen would take any action.

Unexpectedly, Jiang Chen completely ignored Du Guyun and even her. For half a month, Jiang Chen never appeared before Ye Qingcheng, as if he had forgotten her entirely.

This made Ye Qingcheng quite uncomfortable. Jiang Chen used to appear before her every few days, which annoyed her. Now that he was absent, she found herself oddly unsettled.
