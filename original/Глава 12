Chapter 12: My Good Sister, Following You Was Indeed the Right Choice!

“Dammit!” Du Guyun’s face alternated between green and black, embarrassed by his failed attempt to show off under the watchful eyes of many.

Thankfully, not many knew who Du Guyun was, aside from being a disciple of the Primordial Sect. Some disciples from the Primordial Sect couldn’t help but chuckle, not out of mockery, but because Du Guyun’s overconfidence was amusing.

“Spirit Palace Realm and you dare to show off? Come back when you’re at Soul Passage Realm!” Wang Ba sneered condescendingly at Du Guyun. If Du Guyun were at Soul Passage Realm, Wang Ba might have understood, but a mere Spirit Palace Realm daring to step forward?

“I am a disciple of the Primordial Sect!” Du Guyun, realizing he couldn’t use force, invoked the name of his sect, hoping to intimidate by association. The reputation of the Primordial Sect often made others hesitant to provoke its disciples.

“So what if you’re a disciple of the Primordial Sect?” Wang Ba retorted. “I’ve defeated countless disciples from your sect. One less or more of you makes no difference to me. If you were the Holy Son, we might have stepped aside, but just a regular disciple trying to use the Primordial Sect’s name to pressure us?”

However, Wang Ba and his brothers were unmoved. The Celestial Sect, despite being inferior to the Primordial Sect, was still a top-notch force. Moreover, in conflicts among the younger generation, the older generation wouldn’t intervene. Regardless of one’s extraordinary background, if they were inferior in strength, it was their own problem.

“Hmph, if our Holy Son were here, would you dare to stand in our way?” a disciple from the Primordial Sect spoke up discontentedly.

“Heh, if the Holy Son really came, we would have already gone inside!” Wang Ba replied nonchalantly. They were known for bullying the weak and fearing the strong, admitting openly that they had only stopped others because no outstanding disciples from the Primordial Sect were present.

Upon hearing this, the crowd was furious, especially Du Guyun. The name of the Holy Son of the Primordial Sect irritated him. Why was he so special? It was just because of his better talent and background.

Du Guyun believed if he had the same resources, he wouldn’t be weaker. But he also knew how deeply respected Jiang Chen, the Holy Son, was among the Primordial Sect disciples. Voicing such thoughts would make it impossible for him to stay in the sect.

Jiang Chen wouldn’t even need to act personally; the elders below could easily sweep him out of the sect.

Time flowed like a gentle stream, and three hours passed. Due to Wang Ba and his brothers’ obstruction, many young disciples couldn’t proceed any further. It wasn’t until Wang Ba and his brothers felt enough time had passed and entered themselves, that these disciples could follow closely behind.

Du Goyun was particularly stifled, helpless against others’ oppression. Moreover, since the passage had been open for quite a while, they would have missed many opportunities by entering now.

“Celestial Sect’s Wang brothers, huh? I’ll remember you,” Du Goyun muttered darkly, his eyes cold, deeply imprinting the four brothers in his mind.

On the other side, after the passageway opened and while everyone was heading to the main peak, Ye Qingcheng quietly made her way to the third peak, undetected, especially avoiding Yan Ruyu. Yan Ruyu had always been hostile to her, and if she were spotted, she would undoubtedly be obstructed and possibly even followed. This would prevent her from securing the two treasures.

Quickly, she entered the third peak and found herself at the back of it. There, she discovered complex scriptures inscribed on a massive rock wall. Each character was gilded, emitting a faint golden glow, filled with mystical power.

“Heaven-Piercing Palm!” Ye Qingcheng’s eyes flashed, and she immediately sat cross-legged to memorize the scripture engraved on the wall. The scripture was tens of thousands of characters long, each character extremely profound.

However, for a genius like Ye Qingcheng, it was easy to memorize. After memorizing the Heaven-Piercing Palm, she pondered for a moment and then waved her hand, cutting the entire rock wall and storing it in her spatial ring.

“Now, all that’s left is the Yin-Yang Qi!” she thought to herself. She moved toward a cave. Passing through the dark passage, a light appeared in the distance. She quickly rushed in. What came into view were black and white lights radiating brilliantly, formless gases swirling around like two true dragons spiraling in the cave.

“Innate Yin-Yang Qi!” Ye Qingcheng’s eyes lit up, showing a hint of joy. Indeed, as Jiang Chen had said, there really was Innate Yin-Yang Qi here.

Absorbing this gas could forge a Yin-Yang physique not weaker than a divine body. However, she faced a dilemma in how to collect the Innate Yin-Yang Qi and wasn’t planning to refine it here and now.

Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, “Giggle, good sister, following you was indeed the right choice! You actually found the Innated Yin-Yang Qi!” The laughter, like the sound of bells, echoed throughout the cave.

Ye Qingcheng’s expression stiffened; it was Yan Ruyu’s voice. She turned sharply, and there stood Yan Ruyu in a black dress, her pale jade feet shining brightly, slowly walking in the void, her stunning appearance captivating.

“Flirty wench!” Ye Qingcheng clenched her teeth in anger. How could this flirty wench be here?

Sensing Ye Qingcheng’s confusion, Yan Ruyu covered her mouth and giggled, “I saw my good sister trying to avoid me, so I deliberately hid. I didn’t expect it would actually pay off!”

“Innate Yin-Yang Qi, this is exactly what our All Pleasure Sect desires most!” Yan Ruyu’s eyes gleamed with fervor as she spoke.
