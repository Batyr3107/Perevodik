Chapter 4: Don’t Block My Action!

In the Cangmang Mountain Range, a sprawling expanse of mountains lay densely packed like coiled dragons, vast and endless. Known as one of the most famous mountain ranges in the Eastern Wilderness, the Cangmang Range was rich in resources and teeming with countless heavenly treasures, attracting numerous cultivators for training at all times.

At this moment, in a cave within the mountains, a young man in a black robe sat quietly, occasionally glancing into the distance. His ordinary appearance was overshadowed by a cold and forbidding aura that sent shivers down the spine.

“Master, do you think my plan will succeed?” Du Guyun, the young man in the cave, spoke as if talking to himself. Suddenly, a flicker of light appeared, and a hazy figure materialized in front of him. It was Canglao, Du Guyun’s ring spirit, a former top powerhouse of the Nine Heavens Realm, now existing as an aged, ethereal being.

“My disciple, not to discourage you, but I find your plan a bit too simplistic,” Canglao said slowly.

“Ye Qingcheng is a top disciple of the Primordial Holy Land, intelligent and astute. Such a ploy is unlikely to deceive her.” Canglao was skeptical when he first heard about Du Guyun’s plan to play the hero and win over Ye Qingcheng’s heart, considering it overly common.

Du Guyun had orchestrated a situation where he would ‘rescue’ Ye Qingcheng, leading beasts to attack her and then stepping in to protect her, albeit not to defeat the beasts but to shield Ye Qingcheng and escape with her.

The plan was to win her over by risking his life for her, but it was fraught with holes. The sudden beast rampage and Du Guyun’s convenient presence could raise suspicion in anyone as discerning as Ye Qingcheng, not just any smart woman.

“Master, I think my plan is flawless and bound to succeed,” Du Guyun said confidently, believing his plan to be perfect. If he appeared gravely injured while saving Ye Qingcheng, he was sure to move her.

Seeing Du Guyun’s confidence, Canglao sighed but didn’t say much else, inwardly critiquing the plan as treating the other party like a fool. In fact, in the original story, Canglao was astonished by Du Guyun’s success, considering the plan too common and almost foolish. Only a fool would fall for it.

However, Ye Qingcheng, the so-called top disciple of the Primordial Holy Land, did fall for it, perhaps due to the inexplicable dynamics between male and female protagonists. Even the most ludicrous of events can seem normal under the influence of destiny.

“She’s here!” Du Guyun suddenly stood up, his eyes fixated on an ethereal white figure in the distance. The person approaching was none other than Ye Qingcheng, the very person Du Guyun had been waiting for.

In the Cangmang Mountain Range, Ye Qingcheng, who had become the unwitting target of Du Guyun’s wait-and-see strategy, furrowed her brows and wondered, “No beast rampage yet? And I’ve detected the presence of other people nearby!”

To validate Jiang Chen’s insights, she had purposely roamed the Cangmang Mountains for a while, hoping to encounter the so-called beast rampage.

Suddenly, the ground shook violently, reminiscent of a giant earth dragon turning over. Beasts swarmed from all directions towards Ye Qingcheng. “Here it comes!” With a grave expression, she calmly surveyed the uncontrolled beasts surrounding her.

Due to her preparedness, she wasn’t overly panicked. Confronted with innumerable beasts, she unleashed bursts of divine light, and her sword radiance swept around like an endless river, annihilating everything in its path. The beast army couldn’t advance further, being held back by her sword light.

However, to verify the facts, Ye Qingcheng didn’t go for the kill but instead intentionally exposed weaknesses to attract Du Guyun’s intervention. As a result of her deliberate actions, she sustained several heavy injuries and appeared on the brink of collapse.

“The timing is perfect!” exclaimed Du Guyun, who then flew into action, smashing the beasts in front of Ye Qingcheng. He wore a self-perceived handsome smile and asked, “Miss, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” Ye Qingcheng replied with a cold, focused gaze.

“This lady, my name is Du Guyun. May I know your name?” Du Guyun continued to battle the beasts while speaking to Ye Qingcheng.

Though the beasts were numerous, their strength wasn’t too formidable. The most powerful were only at the Divine Passage Realm, and there weren’t many of them. Du Guyun, despite being only at the eighth level of the Divine Palace Realm, easily defeated the beasts due to his protagonist status.

“I can’t believe it actually worked!” Canglao’s soul form twitched at the mouth, feeling that the success of such a strategy was absurd.

He wondered if he had overestimated the talents of the Primordial Holy Land’s top disciple or if the standards of the Primordial Holy Land had fallen so low. Despite Du Guyun’s exceptional abilities, the overwhelming number of beasts soon put him under immense pressure.

“Be careful, Miss!” Du Guyun shouted, throwing himself in front of Ye Qingcheng to block the attacking beasts. Despite the fierce battle and his increasing injuries, he was thrilled, believing Ye Qingcheng must be deeply moved by now.

Unbeknownst to him, Ye Qingcheng was not only unmoved but also revealed a cold smirk, having anticipated this scenario. She quickly covered her reaction and sternly said, “Step back!”

“No, I can’t let these beasts harm you!” Du Guyun mistakenly thought Ye Qingcheng was concerned about him, feeling even more invigorated. He believed that the more severe his injuries, the more she would be touched, and thus he could win her heart.

In the next moment, Ye Qingcheng’s words left Du Guyun utterly astonished. “You’re blocking my way! If you don’t leave, how can I kill these beasts?” “Moreover, I don’t need your help, it’s completely unnecessary, I can handle it myself!” Ye Qingcheng said coldly.

She was, after all, a top disciple of the Primordial Holy Land, with a cultivation of an eighth level Divine Passage Realm. She had brought several trump cards for this occasion and could handle the beasts without Du Guyun’s so-called protection, which was actually hindering her.
